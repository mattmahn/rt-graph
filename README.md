# rt-graph

Visualize the network of retweeters for any given tweet.

I made this because [Casey Liss][casey] [mentioned][blog] that he wanted some
way to browse the retweeters of his [tweet][]. So I decided to make that.


## Usage

1. Get the ID of the tweet. (It's the 819714525519872000 in
   https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/819714525519872000)
1. Go to http://mattmahn.github.io/rt-graph
1. Enter the tweet ID
1. Click "Graph!"
1. Be amazed

1. Set the consumer key & secret either in `config/local.toml` or as the
   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` and `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` environment variables.
1. Get your app's bearer token by running `scripts/fetch_bearer_token.js` and
   set it like above.
